Physalia R Advanced Course 2020

* You will find the lectures – as `Rmd` (R markdown) and HTML files in the
[Lectures](Lectures/) folder. To view the lectures, you need to download
the HTML file to your computer (otherwise you will be viewing the HTML
source code).

* You will find the exercises – as `md` (markdown) files in the
[Exercises](Exercises/) folder.

* Data sets are in the [Data](Data/) folder. You can download a data set if
  you click on "raw" when viewing a CSV data set (with Excel files, you
  will get directly an option to save it). Alternatively, you can use the
  link to the raw file ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com...") from R, for
  example

```
read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/january3/Radvanced2020/master/Data/iris.csv")
